# Summary

//TBD

## Supported Boards

Every board supported by [SwiftyGPIO](https://github.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO): RaspberryPis, BeagleBones, C.H.I.P., etc...

To use this library, you'll need a Linux ARM board with Swift 3.x.

The example below will use a RaspberryPi 2 board but you can easily modify the example to use one the other supported boards, a full working demo projects for the RaspberryPi2 is available in the `Examples` directory.

## Usage

//TBD

## Installation

Please refer to the [SwiftyGPIO](https://github.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO) readme for Swift installation instructions.

Once your board runs Swift, if your version support the Swift Package Manager, you can simply add this library as a dependency of your project and compile with `swift build`:

```swift
  let package = Package(
      name: "MyProject",
      dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/uraimo/MPU-6050.swift.git", majorVersion: 1),
      ]
  ) 
```

The directory `Examples` contains sample projects that uses SPM, compile it and run the sample with `./.build/debug/TestMPU6050`.

If SPM is not supported, you'll need to manually download the library and its dependencies: 

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uraimo/DS1307.swift/master/Sources/DS1307.swift https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO/master/Sources/SwiftyGPIO.swift https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO/master/Sources/Presets.swift https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO/master/Sources/I2C.swift https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO/master/Sources/SunXi.swift  

And once all the files have been downloaded, create an additional file that will contain the code of your application (e.g. main.swift). When your code is ready, compile it with:

    swiftc *.swift

The compiler will create a **main** executable.
